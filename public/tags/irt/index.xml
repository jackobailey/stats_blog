      <description>One of the laments I often hear in social science is that we don’t take measurement error seriously enough. Fair enough! This blogpost is a record of me attempting to take it seriously. I’m going to focus on error-in-variables models with IRT estimates in this post, but I’ve also been playing around with multiple over-imputation and plausible values, so other brands are available.1
tl;dr measurement error is really hard to deal with, but error-in-variables regression seems to be able to play reasonably nicely with IRT models after a bit of work.</description>
