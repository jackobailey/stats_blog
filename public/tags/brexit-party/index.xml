      <description>John Curtice, Stephen Fisher, and Patrick English made headlines recently for claiming that Nigel Farage’s decision to stand down his party in certain seats saved the Labour Party from an even worse result in the 2019 general election. They have a nice blog on the topic that they released on Elections Etc. today. I also have some data on this topic, but haven’t released it until now.
In the middle of the 2019 campaign there was an ONS announcement of the latest GDP data.</description>
