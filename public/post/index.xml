      <description>In my previous post I showed that the minimum inverse-probability weight in a simple random sample should be equal to the response rate of the survey. However, since simple random samples are basically non-existent in the real world, I need to work out the equivalent constraint for complex survey designs.
This post summarizes my progress so far towards doing that.
In the previous post I speculated that the constraint for \(i\)’s weight should be:</description>

      <title>Farage&#39;s Brexit Party Announcement and the 2019 Campaign</title>

      <description>John Curtice, Stephen Fisher, and Patrick English made headlines recently for claiming that Nigel Farage’s decision to stand down his party in certain seats saved the Labour Party from an even worse result in the 2019 general election. They have a nice blog on the topic that they released on Elections Etc. today. I also have some data on this topic, but haven’t released it until now.
In the middle of the 2019 campaign there was an ONS announcement of the latest GDP data.</description>

      <title>A simple function for creating dummy variables in R</title>

      <description>As someone interested in economic voting, I create a lot of dummy variables. Most often, I have to use self-reported vote choice to create a dummy variable that shows if a respondent voted for the incumbent party or not.
For the uninitiated, a “dummy variable” is like a light switch. It can be either “off” (where it equals 0) or “on” (where it equals 1). We tend to use them to work out how the presence of something we’re interested in affects an outcome.</description>

      <description>As my first post on the File Drawer, I wanted to share a survey statistics result that surprised me and that I haven’t seen derived before. At the very least, I know that this result is not used in any applied weighting work that I’ve seen.
How differential nonresponse ruins the law of large numbersRandom samples have fantastic statistical properties. As the sample size increases, the law of large numbers guarantees that your estimate will converge on the true population value.</description>
