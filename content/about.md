This blog has three authors: Jack Bailey, Jon Mellon, and Chris Prosser. We're colleagues on the [British Election Study](https://www.britishelectionstudy.com), though the blog is not affiliated with the BES. Instead, it's a place for us to share small insights that we've come across in our day-to-day work. Some of these insights will be about statistics, some will be about politics, and some will be miscellaneous. But all come with an important health warning: they might be wrong and are always subject to revision.

If you want to get in touch, or just see what we're up to, you can reach us on Twitter: [@PoliSciJack](https://www.twitter.com/PoliSciJack), [@jon_mellon](https://www.twitter.com/jon_mellon), [@caprosser](https://www.twitter.com/caprosser).
